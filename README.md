# ListViewRemPos_J3x_1.1

This project (a joomla-plugin) for the administrator backend, solves the problem, that when selecting an entry 
in a joomla listview the return to the listview goes not to the top(joomla standard) entry.
You will return exaxtly to your postion in tha liestview, where you were, at selecting time.
