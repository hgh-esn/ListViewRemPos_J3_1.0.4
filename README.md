# plg_system_ListViewRemPos

This project (a joomla-plugin) for the administrator backend, solves the problem behavior of Joomla-Listviews.
So when selecting an entry in a joomla listview, the return goes to the top(joomla standard) entry.
Whin this plugin, you will return exaxtly to your postion in the liestview, where you were, when selecting the item.
So you can avoid a lot of scrolling thru the listview.
